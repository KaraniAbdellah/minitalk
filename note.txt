// Processes and signals
/*
    - Signal: is a message that is sent to a process to indicate a particular event
        has occurred or to request a particular action to be taken.
    - Process: is a program that is being executed by the computer.

    - Remember: a signal is just telling a process to do a certain thing

    - To send a signal to a certain process you need the PID --> kill <PID>
    - To Know The PID --> top
        kill 1828 $$ killall brave $$ ps -Af | grep brave

// Function Used
/*
    signal():
        "sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);"
        signal function allows you to specify a function to be called
            when a particular signal is received.
        A signal is a message from the operating system to a 
            program indicating that some event has occurred

    sigemptyset():
        "int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);"
        The sigemptyset function is used to initialize a signal set to the empty set,
            which means that it does not contain any signals. Signal sets
            are used by some functions, such as sigaction

    sigaddset():
        "int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);"
        This function allows to add a signal to a set of signals.
